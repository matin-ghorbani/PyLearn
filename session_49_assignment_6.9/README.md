# 6.9.Assignment -> MLP using TensorFlow (Multilayer Perceptron)

## In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: ðŸ›³
```what sorts of people were more likely to survive?```

### Install Dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## I chased these features to train the model:
- Pclass
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp
- Parch
- Fare

## I wrote a 3 layers model for training with 350 epochs
![my model accuracies](./results/model_accuracies.png)
![my model losses](./results/model_losses.png)

## My neural network results are:
- **test accuracy: *0.93540***
- **test loss: *0.49829***
